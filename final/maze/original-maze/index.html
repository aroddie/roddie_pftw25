      <h1>Maze 1.0</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This was my original attempt at the maze before discovering the p5.play library.</p>
    <p>I was unsatisfied with the collision handling of the maze walls because the dot had a tendency to get stuck and phase through the wall. </p>
    <p>This version is "playable" in that the character can be moved, but it is clearly unfinished (only the right wall has collision programmed). I wanted to keep it in as a documentation of my progress.</p>
